# BDMM-Flow Supplementary Material

This repository contains supplementary material for the BEAST 2 package [BDMM-Flow](https://github.com/tochsner/BDMM-Flow). It contains scripts to benchmark BDMM-Flow against BDMM-Prime using both synthetic data produced using the `benchmark` module in the BDMM-Flow package and BEAST 2 runs on real data.
